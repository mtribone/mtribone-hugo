<h2>About</h2>
<p>I am a Pennsylvania-based digital designer with a fine arts background. I have been designing and developing websites and illustrations for online learning, small businesses, non-profit organizations, and motion for over 20 years. I am experienced in balancing art and functionality because my early art career, functional ceramics, was steeped in making valuable products.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to collaborating with others on their web projects, illustrations, and 3D. Using participatory design means that we get to commit to creating together. I am interested in solving design challenges to connect people with information and services that break user experiences from the canned web environment. Templates, stock photos, stock illustrations, modular code, frameworks, etc., all have their place, but we need to use these resources in creative ways. Or we can create your vision from scratch.</p>
<p>Either way, Iâ€™m open to listening to you describe your next big idea.</p>
