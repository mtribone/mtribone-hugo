I have been designing and developing websites and illustrations for online learning, small businesses, non-profit organizations, and motion for over 20 years. I am experienced in balancing art and functionality because my early art career, functional ceramics, was steeped in making valuable products.
I am looking forward to collaborating with others on their web projects, illustrations, and 3D. Using participatory design means that we get to commit to creating together.</description></item></channel></rss>
